## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Retail Sales Data Engineering Pipeline** built using **Azure Databricks** following the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

The pipeline ingests raw data, transforms it, and builds business-ready fact and dimension tables using Delta Lake.

It is fully orchestrated using **Databricks Workflows**.

## 🔹 Bronze Layer

- Loads raw retail data
- Stores data in Delta format
- Ensures schema consistency

---

## 🔹 Silver Layer

- Cleans null values
- Applies transformations
- Standardizes schema

---

## 🔹 Gold Layer

Creates business-level tables:

- Customer Dimension
- Product Dimension
- Sales Fact Table

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Orchestration

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Databricks Workflows** with task dependencies:

1️⃣ Bronze Ingestion  
2️⃣ Silver Transformation  
3️⃣ Gold Dimension Tables  
4️⃣ Gold Fact Table  

Each task depends on the successful completion of the previous layer.
